# sysadmin-toolbox

## A repository of walkthroughs and scripts, and one liners.
This repo is created on the blood, sweat, and tears of IT work and System Administration.

All jokes aside - when working in IT/IS, you often find yourself learning quite a bit for a task.
However, you may not have a chance to keep those skills fresh by using them again, right away.
This repo is an attempt to alleviate that problem - any time we find or create a script, discover a way to make X work with Y, or figure out why Z is always popping ***OFF*** - we'll upload that work here (where authorized). 

All files, data, scripts, and information in this repo is for people who know what they're doing only. Using scripts/files or following any guide you find here is completely at your own risk.
